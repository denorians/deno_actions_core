## Acknowledgments

This project was adapted from the core package in
[github.com/actions/toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit), mainly by
replacing Node-dependent functions with Deno equivalents. This includes
documentation. File names, organization, and style have also changed to reflect
that of a conventional Deno module. Note that the original
[MIT-licensed](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/core/LICENSE.md)
package was created by GitHub.

Copies and derivatives of this codebase should preserve all included
acknowledgments.
